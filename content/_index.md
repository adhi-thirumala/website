{% alert(type="info", title="about me") %}
i'm at the ~~cornfields~~ university of illinois urbana-champaign majoring in computer science + linguistics and minoring in math. i'm interested in systems software, programming language theory, compilers, large-scale infrastructure, and nlp. i have done research in the past on nlp alongside [dr. elisa ferracane](https://elisaf.github.io). i'm also an ardent linux user and i currently daily drive ~~fedora~~ arch linux on my framework laptop (although the more i look at it, the more i get enthralled with the idea of [nixos](https://nixos.org/)). currently, i'm the treasurer for [acm @ uiuc](https://acm.illinois.edu) - the largest collective of CS students at Illinois - where i manage funds and enable many students across the club to pursue their passions and build projects. my introduction to this organization was the amazing [gnu linux user group](https://lug.acm.illinois.edu) where i was given an addiction to ricing, the tiling windows manager, and many other ways to waste time "productively".

outside of academics, i was a policy debate competitor in high school, and i am continuing this activity in college by coaching a group of highly motivated high schoolers from small programs, similar to the one i was from. i also enjoy playing many old Nintendo games and enjoy being part of the homebrew scene for many of these older consoles. a not so long time ago, i went to fox chapel area high school.
